- fix(supabase): Preserve extra search parameters (#12102) by @Tobbe

We call the `restoreAuthState()` function in the Supabase auth integration when
the user gets redirected back to the app. The problem was that this would
completely wipe out all search parameters, including user-defined ones.

With this PR we only delete the parameters that Supabase manages.
